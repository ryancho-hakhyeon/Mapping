# Caesars Cipher

<p> One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount. </p> 

<p> A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on. </p> 

<p> Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. </p> 

<p> All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on. </p>
